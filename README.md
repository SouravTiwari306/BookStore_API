## üì¶ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.x
- MySQL (or compatible relational DB)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sk-SouravKumar/BookStore_API.git
   cd BookStore_API
   ```

2. **Configure your database**  
   Update `application.properties` with your local DB credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bookstore
   spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
   spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
   ```

3. **Build and run the project**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the API**  
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` (default). Use tools like Postman or Swagger to interact with the endpoints.
